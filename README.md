# ROS Setups

Instructions and scripts for the installation of ROS on various platforms, such as Odroid and Intel Edison.

# NOTE: This is the same setup as https://github.com/darknight-007/ros-setups but with changes so that we can install with Docker. It also includes an additional install script for gzweb, and openai-gym. The dockerfile in addition, installs tensorflow-gpu
